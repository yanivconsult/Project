# ServiceCo — Service Selling Website (HTML/CSS/JS)
A modern, responsive, high‑converting template to sell services online. Built with semantic HTML, utility CSS variables, and small vanilla JS for interactivity.

## Files
- `index.html` — the main page (single‑page layout with sections)
- `styles.css` — styles with CSS variables, responsive grids, and components
- `script.js` — navbar toggle, dropdown, active section highlighting, form validation
- `assets/` — placeholder favicon + OG image (generated)

## How to use
1. Download all files and open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Update the brand name, copy, pricing, and section content to match your service.
3. Replace placeholder testimonials and tweak colors in `:root` if needed.
4. Wire the contact form to your backend or a form service (formspree, etc.).

## Notes
- Accessible: skip link, focus styles, ARIA on navigation and dropdowns.
- SEO‑ready: meta tags, Open Graph, semantic headings, fast performance.
- Mobile‑first: sticky header, touch‑friendly dropdowns, responsive grids.
